<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
PyKDE4 is a set of Python bindings for KDE4's kdelibs. It includes the modules kdecore, solid,
kdefx, kdeui, kio, kparts, kutils, khtml, kdeprint and two modules - kate and ktexteditor - which
are useful in developing plugins for the kate and kwrite text editors.
</p>
<p>
PyKDE4 should be installed in a path known to Python (usually /usr/lib/python/site-packages). PyKDE4/
is the top level directory for all PyKDE4 modules, so an import statement and code references must look like:
</p>
<pre>
from PyKDE4.kdeui import KApplication
...
app = KApplication ()
</pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre>
import PyKDE4.kdeui
...
app = PyKDE4.kdeui.Kapplication ()
</pre>
<p>
Other forms are also possible. The form:
</p>
<pre>
from PyKDE4.kdeui import *
</pre>
<p>
is not recommended, as there may be clashes between object names in the various PyKDE4 modules.
</p>
<a name="components"><h3>PyKDE4 Components</h3></a>
<p><b>kdecore</b></p>
<p>
kdecore contains classes for handling non-graphical needs of PyKDE4 applications, basic program information
(KAboutData, KCmdLineArgs), URL handling (KUrl, KMimetype), date and time (KDateTime), file operations 
(KAutoSaveFile, KSaveFile), localization and translation (KLocale, KLocalizedString, i18n, ki18n), one
config file mechanism (KConfig) and access to KService related mechanisms.
</p>
<p><b>solid</b></p>
<p>
solid contains classes for discovering the hardware and hardware capabilities on a system
</p>
<p><b>kdefx</b></p>
<p>
kdefx is a small module that includes some graphics effects.
</p>
<p><b>kdeui</b></p>
<p>
kdeui is the largest module in PyKDE4 and includes the classes necessary to create a KDE4/PyKDE4
application (KApplication, KUniqueApplication) and its main window (KMainWindow, KXmlGuiWindow),
classes for actions (KAction, the KStandardAction namespace) most of the KDE4 widgets, pre-written 
or reusable dialogs and the base class for KDE4 dialogs (KDialog, KMessageBox, KColorDialog) and
an alternative config file mechanism (KConfigSkeleton).
</p>
<p><b>kio</b></p>
<p>
The kio module includes classes to interact with and intiate KIO slaves (KIO:Job and descendants, KIO.NetAccess).
It also contains the KFile* classes, including those which pop up file or directory selection dialogs, and
a bookmark handling class (KBookmark and releated).
</p>
<p><b>kparts</b></p>
<p>
kparts includes classes to allow you to embed KParts in your application (creating a reusable KPart requires
C++). It also includes classes that add capabilities to KHTMLPart (BrowserExtension, BrowserHostExtension).
</p>
<p><b>kutils</b></p>
<p>
kutils is a small module that includes some utility classes.
</p>
<p><b>khtml</b></p>
<p>
khtml includes classes (KHTMLPart, KHTMLView) that allow you to build a web browser into your application. This
module also includes and extensive set of classes for DOM handling.
</p>
<p><b>kdeprint</b></p>
<p>
kdeprint provides an interface for printing documents from KDE4/PyKDE4 applications.
</p>
<p><b>kate and ktexteditor</b></p>
<p>
The kate and ktexteditor modules provide the ability to create plugins for kate and related classes.
