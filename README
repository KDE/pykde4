don't bother reading the INSTALL doc - it is of zero use.

PyKDE 4 - Python bindings for KDE 4.7
=====================================
Main Developer - Simon Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>, Jim Bublitz <jbublitz@nwinternet.com>


Install
-------
See INSTALL for installation instructions and read the Tips below.


License
-------
Each files should have its our license header, but generally speaking the code
that makes up the PyKDE4 Python modules (libraries) are Í„"LGPL or later", and
the rest is "GPL or later".


Tips
----

* Python 3 is supported for the base bindings but currently not for the
  plugins and embedding. When running cmake specify which python executable
  you want to use by passing in the -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE= option.
  For example:

    cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3

* Almost every class and method in the KDE API is supported. For most
  developers PyKDE4 is in good enough shape to start porting and
  development of PyKDE4 based programs.

* PyKDE4 is very sensitive to binary compatibility in KDE's libraries.
  (PyKDE uses also every class and method in KDE.) Don't be surprised if
  your PyKDE install breaks after updating your KDE SVN checkout. I (Simon)
  will do my best to fix things as they break, and to try to keep things up
  to date when new methods and classes are added to the KDE API.

* If you have written some example code which could be included with PyKDE4,
  then get in touch!

* The modules, kdecore, kdeui, solid, sonnet etc are now located under a
  "PyKDE4" top level module. For example, this is what you need now:

     from PyKDE4.kdecore import *

     or

     from PyKDE4 import kdecore

* Bug reports can be sent to Jim Bublitz <jbublitz@nwinternet.com> and Simon
  Edwards <simon@simonzone.com>
