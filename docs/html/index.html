<h2>PyKDE4 Documentation</h2>
<p>
PyKDE4 is a set of Python bindings for the KDE4 kdelibs. It provides:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to write KDE4 applications using Python</li>
  <li>The ability to create graphical interfaces using KDE4 and Qt4 widgets</li>
  <li>The ability to create fully featured web browsers, text editors or other
       document viewers completely from Python, or embed those features in your application</li>
  <li>The ability to code at a higher level of abstraction, since KDE4 and Python provide convenient
       access to numerous features programs regularly require.</li>
  <li>Rapid development of applications, especially when combined with integrated development
	environments like eric4 and tools like QtDesigner or QtLinguist</li>
  <li>PyKDE4 provides access to 7 modules, 34 namespaces, and about 600 classes, 10,000 methods, 350 enums and 100 variables</li>
</ul>

<p>
The documentation set provides important information about using PyKDE4, tutorials on programming with Python
and PyKDE4, numerous example programs, and a documentation/example browser (<b>pykdedocs</b>) that integrates
all of this information into a easily used framework.
</p>
<p>
If your are using pykdedocs to read this documentation, please take the time to read the docs for pykdedocs
itself, including adding/editing bookmarks, and enabling/disabling samples.

PyKDE4 is built on software developed by
