PyKDE 4 currently requires the following:

* A recent Python (2.5.1 is what I've been using)

* SIP version 4.7-snapshot-20070811 or later. Get the development snapshot
  from Riverbank Computing.
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/index.php

* PyQt 4.3-snapshot-20070813 or later. Also available at Riverbank Computing.

* KDE 4 libs and development headers etc.

Depending on how you work, you might want to install the extra python
modules into a separate Python interpreter installation.

Once the dependencies are installed, run the following in this
current directory:

>> python configure.py && make && su -c"make install"
>> python importTest.py

python configure.py -h will list the command line switches. Most
installations will work as above.

If the importTest.py works without any error messages, then your
installation is in good shape. Congratulations.
