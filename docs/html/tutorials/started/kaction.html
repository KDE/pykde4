<h1>Tutorial - Fourth Program</h1>
<h3>KAction</h3>
<p>
In a graphical application, users interact with application using menus, toolbar
buttons and keyboard shortcuts. The KAction class provides a convenient and efficient
way. 
</p>
<p>
This tutorial differs slightly from the
<a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Using_KActions">Techbase
tutorial</a> it was derived from.
</p>
<p>
In even a small application, it's common to create a number of KActions - one
for each of the different menu entries - so coding them compactly is important.
</p>
<p>
Our goal in this tutorial is to add two menu items: a Clear menu item with an
associated button that appears in the toolbar, and a Quit menu item that we
can link to something, possibly in our code.  The Clear menu item and toolbar
button will clear whatever text has been typed in the edit window of the app.
</p>
<p>
All of the necessary changes occur in the <i>MainWindow</i> class, which
now looks like this:
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff">

class MainWindow (KXmlGuiWindow):
    def __init__ (self):
        KXmlGuiWindow.__init__ (self)

        self.textArea =  KTextEdit ()
        self.setCentralWidget(self.textArea)

        self.setupActions()

    def setupActions (self):
        clearAction = KAction(KIcon("edit-clear"), i18n("Clear"), self)
        self.actionCollection().addAction("clear", clearAction)
        self.connect (clearAction, SIGNAL ("triggered(bool)"), self.textArea.clear)

        KStandardAction.quit (app.quit, self.actionCollection())

        self.setupGUI(QSize (600, 400), KXmlGuiWindow.Default, os.path.join (sys.path [0],"kactionui.rc"))

</pre>
<p>
We've removed the <i>setupGUI</i> call from <i>MainWindow.__init__</i> and placed it (with
argeuments) at the end of a new method called <i>setupActions</i>
</p>
<p>
To create our Clear menu/toolbar entries, we need to create a KAction that represents this
action. Creating a KAction from scratch requires 4 steps and a lot of explanation.
</p>
<p>
The first step is to create a KAction and give it three properties: an icon, a name, and an
owner:
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff">
clearAction = KAction(KIcon("edit-clear"), i18n("Clear"), self)
</pre>
<p>
The icon chosen ("edit-clear") is a standard KDE icon, and KIcon will find it automatically. The name
for the action ("Clear") will appear in the menu - <i>i18n</i> wraps it so that it can be
automatically translated into different languages. Lastly, the <i>KXmlGuiWindow</i> (self) will be
the owner of this action. We could have created an empty <i>KAction</i> objects and used
<i>KAction</i>'s methods to set the action's properties, but that requires 4 lines of code instead
of one - a big difference if you're creating 10 or 20 actions.
</p>
<p>
If you've done actions using PyKDE3, you may notice that the owner is no longer the main window's
action collection, and the action collection isn't referenced in the <i>KAction</i> constructor
call. In PyKDE4 (or plain KDE4), it's necessary to do an explicit call to add the action to
the action collection, so our second step is:
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff">
self.actionCollection().addAction("clear", clearAction)
</pre>
<p>
Notice that <i>KXmlGuiWindow</i> already owns an action collection that we can reference using
<i>self.actionCollection ()</i>. Notice also that we've given the action a different name (its
"internal" name - "clear"), and provided a reference to the action itself (<i>clearAction</i>).
</p>
<p>
For our action to actually cause something to happen, we have to link the action to some code
that does what we want. We accomplish this using Qt's "signals and slots" mechanism, so our
third step is:
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff">
self.connect (clearAction, SIGNAL ("triggered(bool)"), self.textArea.clear)
</pre>
<p>
<i>connect</i> is a static method belonging to <i>QObject</i>, so we can call it using any
<i>QObject</i> descendant - in this case our <i>KXmlGuiWindow</i> descendant (self).
</p>
Specifying a connection in PyQt/PyKDE is simpler than in C++. We just specify the object which
emits the signal (our action <i>clearAction</i> in this case), we use the <i>SIGNAL</i>
function from <b><i>QtCore</i></b> to provide the signal's C++ signature (in this case
<i>"triggered(bool)"</i>) specified as a character string, and we tell <i>connect</i> what
slot to connect the signal to. In this case, the slot we're using already exists in the
<i>KTextEdit</i> we're using, so we specify <i>self.textArea.clear</i>. The slot can
be any callable Python function or method.
</p>
<p>
If you've been keeping count, we said there were four steps to creating an action, and we
only competed three. The last step applies to all actions we create: We need a GUI file
written in XML that tells KDE how to build the GUI using our actions:
</p>

<pre  style="background-color : #eeeeee;">

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE kpartgui SYSTEM "kpartgui.dtd"&gt;
&lt;gui name="KAction" version="1.2"&gt;
  &lt;ToolBar name="mainToolBar" &gt;
    &lt;text&gt;Main Toolbar&lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;Action name="clear" /&gt;
      &lt;ActionList name="dynamicActionlist" /&gt;
  &lt;/ToolBar&gt;
  &lt;MenuBar&gt;
    &lt;Menu name="file" &gt;
        &lt;text&gt;&amp;File&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;Action name="clear" /&gt;
    &lt;/Menu&gt;
  &lt;/MenuBar&gt;
&lt;/gui&gt;

</pre>
<p>
At the time this is being written, no KDE specification exists to guide the writing of
the XML file, so I generally use an XML file stolen from another application as a guide. Note
that the "internal" name of our action (<i>clear</i>) appears in the ToolBar and MenuBar
sections of the XML file. When we run the application, we should expect a "Clear" entry
to appear in the File menu, and a "Clear" button on the toolbar, and in fact that's what
happens.
</p>
<p>
The second action we want to creat - Quit - is much easier. There are a number of pre-defined
actions collected in <i>KStandardAction</i>. Using them requires only a single line of code:
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff">
KStandardAction.quit (app.quit, self.actionCollection())
</pre>
<p>
For our Quit action we can use the standard action <i>quit</i>. We just need to specify what
slot it connects to (<i>app.quit</i>) and indicate the action collection to add it to.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, we need to tell KDE we're done defining things and it's time to actually build the GUI
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff">
self.setupGUI(QSize (600, 400), KXmlGuiWindow.Default, os.path.join (sys.path [0], "kactionui.rc"))</pre>
</pre>
<p>
This is more complicated than the <i>setupGUI</i> call in the previous tutorial. This call specifies
an initial size for our application (<i>QSize (600, 400)</i>), a flag (which will usually be
<i>KXmlGuiWindow.Default</i> for applications), and a location for our XML file. In this, the .rc
file is located in the same directory as the program we're running, so the path to it can be
found at sys.path [0], where Python inserts the path to the program being run.
</p>
<p>
Normally, KDE looks for XML files in well-known locations. If we had our XML file properly installed,
we could still use <i>setupGUI</i> with no arguments, and KDE would find the XML file from our
application name.
</p>
<p>
However, during development of an application, not all of the files are in their final locations,
so we specify the file's location explicitly here.
</p>
<p>
If you run the application now, you can verify the new Clear menu entry and toolbar button, and
type some text in the app and clear it using the button or menu item.
</p>
<p>
The only thing we haven't done is add a keyboard shortcut for our Clear action. This isn't
difficult, but it involves some other considerations, so I've postponed that to the next
tutorial - KAction2.
