PyKDE 4 currently requires the following:

* A recent Python (2.5.1 is what I've been using)

* SIP version 4.7.8 or later. Get the development snapshot
  from Riverbank Computing.
  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/index.php

* PyQt 4.4.4 or later. Also available at Riverbank Computing.

* KDE 4 libs and development headers etc. kdelibs, kdepimlibs and
  kdesupport modules.

Depending on how you work, you might want to install the extra python
modules into a separate Python interpreter installation. Make sure
that the Python interpreter that you want to use is the first one
found on your $PATH.

see docs/html/install.html for build instructions.

Once everything is built and installed, run the following in this
current directory as a test:

    python importTest.py

If the importTest.py works without any error messages, then your
installation is in good shape. Congratulations.
