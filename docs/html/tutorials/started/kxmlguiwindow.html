<h1>Tutorial - Third Program</h1>
<h3>KXmlGuiWindow</h3>
<p>
In this tutorial, we'll take another step towards building a more useful (if still
simple) application. Most graphical programs include things like menus, toolbars and statusbars. This
tutorial will move us in the direction of being able to provide those things.
</p>
<p>
Once again, we've made a few simple changes to the previous program. The first is in the
class we've subclassed to create our main window. In fact all of the changes take place
in <i>class MainWindow</i>
</p>
<pre style="background-color : #f0f8ff;">

class MainWindow (KXmlGuiWindow):
    def __init__ (self):
        KXmlGuiWindow.__init__ (self)

        textArea =  KTextEdit ();
        self.setCentralWidget(textArea);
        self.setupGUI()

</pre>
<p>
Note first that <i>MainWindow</i> now inherits <i>KXmlGuiMainWindow</i>, not <i>KMainWindow</i>
as in the previous tutorial. Correspondingly, we also change the initialization call.
</p>
<p>
We've also added a <i>KTextEdit</i>, which is a simple text editor widget, and made it the main (central)
widget in our program.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, we've made a call to <i>setupGUI ()</i>. To see what effect this has, run the program. You'll
find it now has a menubar and statusbar. From the Help menu, you can select About KXmlGuiWindow and see
what effect <i>KAboutData</i> has.
</p>
<p>
KXmlGuiWindow manages the machinery necessary to provide menus, toolbars and a statusbar. In this case,
KDE gave us some simple menus, but probably not exactly what we need for our application. The next
step looks at using KAction and KStandardAction to tailor the user interface to what we want.
