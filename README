=====================================
Main Developer - Jim Bublitz <jbublitz@nwinternet.com>


Install
-------
See INSTALL for installation instructions and read the Tips below.


License
-------
Each files should have its our license header, but generally speaking the code
that makes up the PyKDE4 Python modules (libraries) are Í„"LGPL or later", and
the rest is "GPL or later".


Tips
----

* Almost every class and method in the KDE API is supported. For most
  developers PyKDE4 is in good enough shape to start porting and
  development of PyKDE4 based programs.

* Yes PyKDE4 uses its own configure.py script for building and to set up its
  Makefiles. To setup to build outside the source tree you can either invoke
  configure.py with the -b <dir> option, or cd to your build directory and
  run configure.py from there. I'll have a look at seeing what I can do to
  better integrate with CMake.

* PyKDE4 is very sensitive to binary compatibility in KDE's libraries.
  (PyKDE uses also every class and method in KDE.) Don't be surprised if
  your PyKDE install breaks after updating your KDE SVN checkout. I (Simon)
  will do my best to fix things as they break, and to try to keep things up
  to date when new methods and classes are added to the KDE API.

* Tools (such as ui file compiler for KDE), docs and more example code will
  be added before KDE 4.0 is released.

* Phonon support is currently absent. We're waiting on some improved
  namespace support in SIP before Phonon can be added.

* If you have written some example code which could be included with PyKDE4,
  then get in touch!

* The modules, kdecore, kdeui, solid, sonnet etc are now located under a
  "PyKDE4" top level module. For example, this is what you need now:

     from PyKDE4.kdecore import *

     or

     from PyKDE4 import kdecore

* Bug reports can be sent to Jim Bublitz <jbublitz@nwinternet.com> and Simon
