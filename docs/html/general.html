<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
PyKDE4 is a set of Python bindings for KDE4's kdelibs. It includes the modules kdecore, solid,
kdeui, kio, kparts, kutils, and khtml.
</p>
<p>
PyKDE4 should be installed in a path known to Python (usually /usr/lib/python/site-packages). PyKDE4/
is the top level directory for all PyKDE4 modules, so an import statement and code references must look like:
</p>
<pre>
from PyKDE4.kdeui import KApplication
...
app = KApplication ()
</pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre>
import PyKDE4.kdeui
...
app = PyKDE4.kdeui.KApplication ()
</pre>
<p>
Other forms are also possible. The form:
</p>
<pre>
from PyKDE4.kdeui import *
</pre>
<p>
is not recommended, as there may be clashes between object names in the various PyKDE4 modules.
</p>
<a name="versions"><h3>Versions and Numbering</h3></a>
<p>
Releases of the tarball versions of PyKDE4 are numbered as follows:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>PyKDE4</dt><dd>All PyKDE4 versions begin with 'PyKDE4'</dd>
<dt>X.Y.Z</dt><dd>A version number corresponding to the highest KDE version supported (see below)</dd>
<dt>blank or #</dt><dd>nothing for the first release for a KDE version, otherwise a sequential number for subsequent
update releases for the same KDE version (bugfixes or new features)</dd>
</dl>
<p>
For example, the first three releases have been PyKDE4-4.0.0 (the initial release), PyKDE4-4.0.0-1 (a bug fix release of 4.4.0)
and PyKDE4-4.0.2 (initial release against KDE 4.0.2 - has some bug fixes in this case). The ChangeLog in the top level directory
outlines changes made between versions.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: The PyKDE4 tarballs should build against <b>any</b> KDE4 release - the files include version information to
generate correct code for the detected installed KDE version. The KDE svn source (kdebindings) may or may not include
version information, and will likely only build against the KDE version it was released with. So in the future, the PyKDE4-4.5.6
tarball sources should still build correctly against KDE 4.0.0.
</p>
<p>
Presently, PyKDE4 is only tested against the most recent KDE, sip, Qt and PyQt versions at the time of release.
However, failure to build against an earlier version should be considered a bug and reported. Also, changes
to KDE do occur that may prevent PyKDE4 versions from building against future KDE versions (for example,
PyKDE4-4.0.2 should build against KDE 4.1.0, but may not, depending on changes in KDE). 
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: Compatibility with older sip or PyQt versions is not guaranteed. In fact, incompatible sip revisions
sometimes are necessary to support new PyKDE4 features.
</p>
<a name="components"><h3>PyKDE4 Components</h3></a>
<p><b>kdecore</b></p>
<p>
kdecore contains classes for handling non-graphical needs of PyKDE4 applications, basic program information
(KAboutData, KCmdLineArgs), URL handling (KUrl, KMimetype), date and time (KDateTime), file operations 
(KAutoSaveFile, KSaveFile), localization and translation (KLocale, KLocalizedString, i18n, ki18n), one
config file mechanism (KConfig) and access to KService related mechanisms.
</p>
<p><b>solid</b></p>
<p>
solid contains classes for discovering the hardware and hardware capabilities on a system
</p>
<p><b>kdeui</b></p>
<p>
kdeui is the largest module in PyKDE4 and includes the classes necessary to create a KDE4/PyKDE4
application (KApplication, KUniqueApplication) and its main window (KMainWindow, KXmlGuiWindow),
classes for actions (KAction, the KStandardAction namespace) most of the KDE4 widgets, pre-written 
or reusable dialogs and the base class for KDE4 dialogs (KDialog, KMessageBox, KColorDialog) and
an alternative config file mechanism (KConfigSkeleton).
</p>
<p><b>kio</b></p>
<p>
The kio module includes classes to interact with and intiate KIO slaves (KIO:Job and descendants, KIO.NetAccess).
It also contains the KFile* classes, including those which pop up file or directory selection dialogs, and
a bookmark handling class (KBookmark and releated).
</p>
<p><b>kparts</b></p>
<p>
kparts includes classes to allow you to embed KParts in your application (creating a reusable KPart requires
C++). It also includes classes that add capabilities to KHTMLPart (BrowserExtension, BrowserHostExtension).
</p>
<p><b>kutils</b></p>
<p>
kutils is a small module that includes some utility classes.
</p>
<p><b>khtml</b></p>
<p>
khtml includes classes (KHTMLPart, KHTMLView) that allow you to build a web browser into your application. This
module also includes and extensive set of classes for DOM handling.
