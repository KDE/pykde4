<h2>Installing PyKDE4</h2>
<a name="ins-pkg"><h3>Packages</h3></a>
<p>
The easiest way to install PyKDE4 is from packages provided by your Linux distribution
or by third parties. PyKDE4 is now included in the kdebindings section of the KDE4 SVN,
so most distributions should have packages available.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this section is for those who want to install from the PyKDE4 source
tarball, or need to upgrade a distribution installation to get recent PyKDE4 enhancements
or bug fixes.
</p>
<a name="ins-req"><h3>Requirements</h3></a>
<p>
PyKDE4 requires 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KDE4</b> - including header files (often in a kdelibs-devel package</li>
<li><b>sip</b> - a version later than September 2007 version 4.7 snapshots</li>
<li><b>PyQt4</b> - version 4.3 or later, compiled against the currently installed sip version</li>
<li><b>PyQt4 sip files</b> - These are required to generate the PyKDE4 C++ code. They're installed
automatically if you compiled PyQt4 on your system. If you installed from a pre-built package, you
may need a PyQt4 devel package for these files.</li>
</ul>
<p>
PyQt4 and sip tarballs are available from <a href="http://riverbankcomputing.com">Riverbank Computing</a>,
as is the most recent PyKDE4 tarball.
</p>
<a name="ins-config"><h3>Configuring PyKDE4</h3></a>
<p>
PyKDE4 is configured for you machine by running
<p>
<pre>
python configure.py
</pre>
<p>
As a normal user (not root), change (cd) to the top level PyKDE4 directory both to run configure.py 
and to run make and make install (below).
</p>
<p>
The option switches for configure.py are detailed at the end of this page - most people won't need
them. configure.py will normally detect automatically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether sip and PyQt4 are installed and are compatible versions</li>
<li>The location of KDE4 files (h files, libs) needed to build PyKDE4</li>
<li>The location where PyKDE4 files will be installed</li>
</ul>
<p>
After determining your machine's setup, configure.py will generate the PyKDE4 C++ files using
the <b>sip</b> program. This takes well under 5 minutes on most machines. configure.py will
also determine the best way to structure the C++ files for your installed version of g++ (gcc).
</p>
<p>
Some versions of gcc 4.0 or 4.2 aren't capable of compiling the large files that are normally
generated for PyKDE4. configure.py will detect the gcc version installed and adjust the
generation of C++ code accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The options (see below) are whether sip concatenates all of the PyKDE4 code into one or two
very large files per PyKDE4 module (for faster compilation) or generates a file-per-class
for each module (somewhat slower, but still fairly speedy on recent gcc versions).
</p>
<a name="ins-comp"><h3>Compiling and Installing</h3></a>
<p>To compile PyKDE4, in the top level PyKDE4 directory, type (as a normal user - not root):</p>
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p>
PyKDE4 will require anywhere from less than 5 minutes to over 30 minutes to compile, depending
on the speed of your machine and availaable memory. If PyKDE4's C++ files were concatenated,
compiling may require that you have more than 256MB of memory installed. If available memory
is low, you can use the switches detailed below to reduce memory requirements during compilation.
</p>
<p>
After PyKDE4 has successfully compiled, you will need to install PyKDE4 <b>as the root user</b>.
Either change (su) to root, or as a normal user type:
</p>
<pre>
su -c"make install"
</pre>
<a name="ins-test"><h3>Testing the Installation</h3></a>
<p>
If PyKDE4 configured, compiled and installed successfully, you are ready to test PyKDE4. A simple
test that catches most build errors is (from the top level PyKDE4 directory):
</p>
<pre>
python importTest.py
</pre>
<p>
This test simply imports each of the modules built. If any "missing symbol" errors prevent loading,
report a bug. The fix is simple, but requires a recompile. This kind of problem should be extremely
rare, and is dependent on how your distribution built KDE4 (the build is non-standard).
</p>
<p>
If importTest.py succeeds in importing all modules, you can beging coding, or start exploring the
example programs and samples that PyKDE4 installed. <b>pykdedocs</b> should have installed in
your executables path - that program provides access to example code, documentation (including this
documentation) and tutorials about using PyKDE4.
</p>
<p>
You can issue a single command line to configure, compile, install and test PyKDE4 (you'll be prompted
for your root password before installation takes place):
</p>
<pre>
python configure.py &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; su -c"make install" &amp;&amp; python importTest.py
</pre>
<a name="ins-34"><h3>PyKDE4 and KDE3/PyKDE3</h3></a>
<p>
PyKDE4 will co-exist with a PyKDE3 installation. It should also be possible to execute PyKDE4 programs
from a KDE3 desktop if you have KDE4 also installed but not currently running (all of PyKDE4 development
was done under KDE3).
</p>
<a name="ins-detail"><h3>configure.py Options</h3></a>
<p>configure.py has the following options, which are described below.</p>
<pre>
Usage:
    python configure.py [-h] [-c] [-d dir] [-g] [-j #] [-k] {-L dir] [-n dir] [-o dir] [-r] [-u] [-v dir] [-w] [-x] [-z file]

where:
    -h      displays this help message
    -c      concatenates each module's C/C++ source files [default]
    -d dir  where the PyKDE modules will be installed [default /usr/lib/python/site-packages]
    -g      always release the GIL (SIP v3.x behaviour - default)
    -i      no concatenation of each module's C/C++ source files
    -j #    splits the concatenated C++ source files into # pieces [default 1]
    -k dir  the KDE base directory
    -L dir  the library directory name [default lib]
    -n dir  the directory containing the KDE lib files
    -o dir  the directory containing the KDE header files
    -r      generates code with tracing enabled [default disabled]
    -u      build with debugging symbols
    -v dir  where the PyKDE .sip files will be installed [default /usr/share/sip/PyKDE4]
    -w      turn on KDE deprecated object warnings when compiling [default off]
    -z file the name of a file containing command line flags
</pre>
<ul style="line-height : 15pt;">
<li><b>-h</b> - displays the help message above</li>
<li><b>-c</b> - concatenates C++ source files.
<p style="margin-left : 20px; padding-top : 5px;">With this option, sip generates a single large source file
for each module (2 files for kdeui and kio because of their size) instead of many small modules (basically one
file per class otherwise.
</p>
<p  style="margin-left : 20px;">
This speeds up compilation significantly - up to 80% faster with older gcc versions, less with newer versions.
It can also cause gcc to freeze, and consumes a large amount of memory during compilation.
</p>
<p  style="margin-left : 20px;">
PyKDE4's configure.py detects gcc versions which are problematical automatically, and disables concatenation
for those gcc versions. Otherwise, concatenation is on by default. It can be turned off using the '-i' switch,
or modified by using -j.
</p></li>
<li><b>-d dir</b> - allows you to specify the directory where the PyKDE4 libraries will be installed. Normally
this is /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages. configure.py detects the version info from the python interpreter that
runs configure.py. You can specify an alternate location.</li>
<li><b>-g</b> - always release Python's GIL before calling a C++ function (default)</li>
<li><b>-i</b> - generate individual files instead of large concatenated files (see -c above)</li>
<li><b>-j #</b> - split each module's C++ file into # pieces; can speed compilation on multicore systems</li>
<li><b>-k dir</b> - the KDE4 base directory; configure.py will normally find this for you</li>
<li><b>-L dir</b> - the directory containing system libs; configure.py will normally find this for you</li>
<li><b>-n dir</b> - the directory containing KDE4 libs; configure.py will normally find this for you</li>
<li><b>-o dir</b> - the directory containing KDE4 header (*.h) files; configure.py will normally find this for you</li>
<li><b>-r</b>- generates code with tracing enabled (default is disabled)</li>
<li><b>-u</b> - retain debugging symbols from compile/link</li>
<li><b>-v dir</b> - the directory where PyKDE4 sip files will be installed; these are required only for bindings that
depend on PyKDE4 (as PyKDE4 depends on PyQt4); default is /usr/share/sip/PyKDE4</li>
<li><b>-w</b> - turn on KDE4 deprecated warnings during compilation; these are off by default</li>
<li><b>-z file</b> - you can put the command line flags in a separate file (one switch per line) and then
specify that file with -z instead of putting the switches on the command line</li>
</ul>
<p>
PyKDE4 should build in most environments without the use of any switches at all.
